# Deployment and Maintenance Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for deployment, backup, and maintenance operations.

## Available Scripts

### ðŸš€ setup-pm2-logs.sh

**Purpose**: Creates the log directory structure required by PM2.

**Usage**:
```bash
# For user-specific logs (recommended for development)
PM2_LOG_DIR=~/.pm2/logs ./scripts/setup-pm2-logs.sh

# For system-wide logs (requires sudo, recommended for production)
sudo ./scripts/setup-pm2-logs.sh
```

**What it does**:
- Creates `/var/log/pm2` (or custom directory)
- Sets appropriate permissions
- Verifies write access

**Run this before**: Starting PM2 for the first time in a new environment

## Creating Additional Scripts

When adding new scripts to this directory:

1. **Make executable**: `chmod +x scripts/your-script.sh`
2. **Add shebang**: Start with `#!/bin/bash`
3. **Use error handling**: Add `set -euo pipefail`
4. **Document in this README**: Add description and usage

### Example Script Template

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script: your-script.sh
# Description: What this script does
# Usage: ./scripts/your-script.sh [args]

set -euo pipefail

# Your script logic here
```
